# warp_tokio_postgres
Minimal backend CRUD example from some tut with some adjustments (todo route)
Another route with graphQL added (stores route). <br>Heavily inspired by https://github.com/hv0rost/graphql-server-sqlx <- Good stuff! <br>
Added minor bug-fixes like no incremental id on database insert.
